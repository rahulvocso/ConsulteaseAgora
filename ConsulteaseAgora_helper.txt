ConsulteaseAgora/ :
***/src may contain test or past files in folders that are no longer needed(not much) delete/remove cautiously after reading codebase***.

android/
	/app/src/main/res/raw contains ringtone file
	/app/src/main/res contains mipmap files(different files for different pixel density),if you want 
	to change app icon


src/react-frontend contains consultease ionic react frontend
	***starting react-frontend in local env, you might encounter metro related errors because of parent folder
	ConsulteaseAgora having different configs,in that case copy paste this folder to different location outside 
	ConsulteaseAgora then 'npm start'


src/socket contains socket related code although it contains socket-client folder,
	socket-client side code is implenented with store/action/index.js. so you can delete socket-client folder
	if you want.

src/socket/socket-server socket-server is base for Socket-Server-ConsultEase(github repo)


Android Studio:
	To run app start emulator first or connect a android device with usb debugging enabled in developer options
	after setting emulator/android device cd inside ConsulteaseAgora and enter commands these serially:
		adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
		yarn start
		press r anytime to hot reload ***if and only if code changes are not visible after saving
		any file changes.
	To generate release build for ***testing:
		Build/Generate signed(bundle/apk)/apk then in prompt select keystore file path to 
		Consultease/android fill necessary detains  and then see build log in bottom navigation(Build -hammer icon)
		in Android Studio
		After build you'll get a prompt on bottom right screen to locate apk folder location
		(usually android/app/release.apk) depending where you selected during first step(in Build/Generate signed(bundle/apk)/apk prompt)

	To generate release build for Android Playstore:
		Build/Generate signed(bundle/apk)/abb(android app bundle first option
		then same procedure as above
			


	Build/clean to clean the project(caches)
	Buils/rebuild to rebuild(after running Build/clean)

Note -  App not properly tested becausee of release build not working,
	removed lot of bugs but still might be present so even if release build doesn't work and
	you want to test changes (***this is a workaround i tried, not recommended time consuming) do following:
	
	Run debug build on a android smartphone by clicking android studio run/play icon on top right.
	Login into consultease with one account(mobile no.) after staring metro(adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081 then npm/yarn start inside ConsulteaseAgora),
	navigate to some paths(fiddle around app).
	Detach this device connect another smartphone and run debug build by clicking android studio run/play icon on top right again then
	starting metro bunndler again by 'adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081 then yarn start'
	login another mobile no. (fiddle around navigating paths in app)
	Now you can initiate call from one app and connect to another 
	*** for any file changes you have to follow the whole process all over again on both devices.
